          ARITST - SONGWRITER - ARRANGER - PRODUCER <br />
          <br />
          Michael Stolar is a 21-year-old independent music artist originally
          from Cleveland, Ohio. He studied Commercial Voice and Songwriting at
          Belmont University in Nashville. Michael is currently releasing his
          first ever EP, which he cannot wait to share with the world! Michael
          has been performing for as long as anyone can remember, and he has
          been writing music since the age of 10. His main influences growing up
          were the likes of Sara Bareilles, Taylor Swift, and Christina Perri,
          all of whom inspired his singer-songwriter style. His production
          sound, on the other hand, is more similar to Lorde, Sigrid, MUNA, and
          Blake Rose, making his sound an original blend of Singer-Songwriter
          and Electropop. The main thing that sets Michael apart from other
          artists is his performance ability: When he gets on stage, all eyes go
          to his mesmerizing stage presence and energy! He is a very seasoned
          performer and loves to sing and arrange a cappella in his free time.
          With the COVID-19 Pandemic, Michael's future plans made an abrupt
          change when he decided to leave school, move to New York City, and
          pursue his music career full time. He has performed at multiple venues
          in the past two years traveling through multiple different cities!
          With all the new project's Michael is working on, 2023 is surely going
          to be a journey you'll want to follow! Interesting in learning more?
